# React boilerplate
This is a basic React boilerplate with a login page. It can be used as a base for other appliactions. Feel free to tweak however you like.

## Features of this boilerplate

1. [Next JS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) - Server side rendering framework
2. [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) - Layout and styling framework
3. [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - Strong types for JS
4. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - For all your HTTP Request needs
5. [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) - State management

The boilerplate provides a login page with 3  Social login providers - Google, Facebook and Github.
However, this requires a backend which [can be found here](https://github.com/martinzokov/spring-backend-boilerplate). Check the repo to see how to set it up.
